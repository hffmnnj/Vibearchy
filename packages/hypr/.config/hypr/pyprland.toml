# Pyprland Configuration
# ====================================
# Pyprland adds useful extensions to Hyprland
# https://github.com/hyprland-community/pyprland
#
# Scratchpads: Floating windows that toggle on/off with a keybind
# - Useful for quick access to utilities without cluttering workspaces
# - Windows slide in from screen edges with animations
# - Remember their position and size
# - Can auto-hide when unfocused
#
# Keybindings (see binds.conf):
# - Super + ` (grave): Terminal scratchpad
# - Super + V: Volume control
# - Super + B: Bluetooth manager
# - Super + C: Calculator
# - Super + M: System monitor
# - Super + G: Lazygit (Git TUI)
# - Super + D: Lazydocker (Docker TUI)
# - Super + Shift + A: Atac (API testing TUI)
# - Super + I: Quick notes

# Scratchpad Definitions
# ====================================
# Each scratchpad is a named window configuration
#
# Common options:
# - command: Program to run (only launched when first toggled)
# - position: X Y position as percentage ("10% 5%" = 10% from left, 5% from top)
# - size: Width Height as percentage ("80% 60%" = 80% screen width, 60% height)
# - animation: Slide direction (fromTop, fromBottom, fromLeft, fromRight)
# - margin: Pixels between window edge and screen edge
# - unfocus: "hide" to auto-hide when window loses focus
# - lazy: true = don't launch until first toggle (faster startup)
